# Do Automation

Wrapper around [dopy](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/dopy) to help in quickly creating new droplets and execute common actions.

The project, as of now, is developed with personal use in mind; no documentation is provided and the default settings are highly subjective.

A list of available commands can be seen by running 
```
    ./do.py
```

while help on a single command can be read by running
```
    ./do.py help [command_substring]
```
